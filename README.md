# cobalt.solutions-unpack

The website https://cobalt.solutions/ is dedicated to the distribution of Call Of Duty Warzone cheats, and the loader may be downloaded here: https://cobalt.solutions/client.exe I've (SEMI) unpacked their loader and provided Hybrid-Analysis links and intezer, so you can dig deeper into these files. One of the files I provided is just an unpacked version, which HAS UNPACKED some items in Themidia, and I also included a dumped version, which will allow you guys to dig further into the memory of the application in an attempt to detect and patch other drivers. Ricocheat Team, please patch these bastards. Thanks.
